Ideas and questions: 

1- Multiple logical qubits in surface17 using the patches idea from "The surface code with a twist" [No-G0...surface-17 has just enough distance for one logical qubit]
2- What are magic states?
3- Lattice surgery to implement a CNOT?
4- Explore the rate of Hook errors using the noise model from Tomita and Svore's paper.
5- Approximate decoherence using Clifford gates (see end of Tomita and Svore's paper).
6- Determine perfomance of surface-17 under leakage (?) (see end of Tomita and Svore's paper).

Note: Check first that noone has aleady done the work.
